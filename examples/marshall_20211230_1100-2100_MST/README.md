# Marshall 2021-12-30 11:00–21:00 MST

This is a Python-only, 121-timestep Marshall input example. The 5-minute
timesteps are inclusive from `2021-12-30T18:00:00Z` through
`2021-12-31T04:00:00Z` (11:00–21:00 MST).
Enter `2021-12-30 11:00` through `2021-12-30 21:00` with the required IANA
timezone `America/Denver`; SWUIFT converts that interval to UTC internally.

Binary inputs are generated under the Git-ignored
`examples/artifacts/marshall_20211230_1100-2100_MST/` directory. The example
contains one HDF5 wind file, `wind.mat`, holding both `wind_s` and `wind_d`.
Ignition values for source timesteps 122–144 are set to zero because they are
outside this package's time window. The exact count is recorded in
`provenance.json`.

## Prepare and package

Run from the `SWUIFT-PUBLIC` repository root:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_marshall_example.py
python scripts/package_marshall_example.py
python scripts/package_marshall_example.py --verify-only
```

The packaging command writes `input-checksums.sha256` here and creates the
reproducible archive
`examples/artifacts/marshall_20211230_1100-2100_MST.tar.gz`. Verification is
read-only and checks staging files, the single `wind.mat` representation,
metadata checksums, and every archived member.

## Reproducible CLI command

Install the public packages as described in the CLI documentation, then run:

```bash
swuift \
  --manifest examples/marshall_20211230_1100-2100_MST/manifest.json \
  --data-root examples/artifacts/marshall_20211230_1100-2100_MST \
  --output-dir /tmp/swuift-marshall-example \
  --lazy-wind \
  --no-out-frames \
  --no-out-video \
  --no-out-gif \
  --no-out-ig-plots \
  --checkpoint-every 0
```

The simulation is intentionally not run by the preparation or packaging
scripts. `manifest.json` is directly consumable by the public scenario CLI;
`provenance.json` documents source hashes and transformations without recording
machine-specific absolute paths.

## Validated output artifact

The completed 121-step public run can be prepared and packaged with:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_marshall_output.py
python scripts/package_marshall_output.py
python scripts/package_marshall_output.py --verify-only
```

Tracked `output-manifest.json`, `output-provenance.json`,
`output-summary.json`, and `output-checksums.sha256` describe the sanitized
output. Binary scientific outputs and representative PNGs are staged under
`examples/artifacts/marshall_20211230_1100-2100_MST-output/`; the reproducible
archive is written beside that directory with a `.tar.gz` suffix.
